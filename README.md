# Artificial-Intelligence

This project involves implementing inference by enumeration for Bayesian networks. The program will read the structure and parameters of a Bayesian network from a file, allowing it to work with any network configuration. Users can interact with the program via a simple interface, set evidence nodes, and perform queries to compute probabilities based on the given network.
